# OpenIddict Sample
## Sample implementation of an authorization server using the library OpenIddict.

The [OpenIddict](https://github.com/openiddict) was created by [KÃ©vin Chalet](https://kevinchalet.com/) to facilitate construction of authorization flows.

This project was made following an amazing [tutorial](https://dev.to/robinvanderknaap/setting-up-an-authorization-server-with-openiddict-part-i-introduction-4jid) by [ Avatar
Robin van der Knaap](https://github.com/robinvanderknaap) ( thanks, man :purple_heart: )

Here you'll find these flows:
* Client Credentials
* Authorization Code With PKCE
